## Take a Class

BlackHoodie classes are announced on our Twitter account [here](https://twitter.com/Blackhoodie_RE). Upcoming events and classes can be seen on the [BlackHoodie calendar page](/calendar/).

## Donate Money
We are registered as a 501(c)(3) non-profit in the US. Therefore donations from US citizens are tax-deductible. You can make a donation in two ways:
1. If your company matches charitable donations through a platform like [Benevity](https://causes.benevity.org), that is the best way to maximize your impact. If your company uses a particular portal and BlackHoodie doesn't show up, please let us know at donate@blackhoodie.re so we can register and make it easier to donate.
2. If you don't have the option to get corporate matching, we'd still really appreciate a direct donation. These help us organize trainings, and cover attendees travel where necessary. You can donate to BlackHoodie [here](link coming up).

## Corporate Sponsorship
If your company is interested in supporting the BlackHoodie mission of bringing more women into cybersecurity, please email sponsor at blackhoodie.re to discuss sponsorship or partnership opportunities.
