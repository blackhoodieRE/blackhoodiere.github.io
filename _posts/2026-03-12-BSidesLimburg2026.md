**We’re happy to announce that Blackhoodie is coming to Belgium for BSides Limburg in spring 2026!**

The event will take place the day before the conference. We’re offering a 1-day free training, for women, by women.

We are also thrilled to announce that tickets to the conference will be given to each attendee, thanks to the support of BSides Limburg. A big thanks to the organisers for providing these tickets and supporting the mission of Blackhoodie, and a big thank you to CybHERstrong (founded by Veerle Peeters) for sponsoring our training.

**TL;DR:**

*   What: Introductory class on low-level security topics.
    
*   When: 12/03/2026
    
*   Where: CORDA CAMPUS, HASSELT
    
*   Registration link: TBD in December

Introduction to reverse engineering and binary exploitation
-----------------------------------------------------------

**Trainer**

Paula (pamoutaf) has a background in penetration testing but as a part of her career switch, she has been learning about reverse engineering and binary exploitation. She has attended Blackhoodie trainings in the past and also recently given a training at Hexacon 2025.

**Workshop description**

In this class, we will learn how to reverse engineer Intel x86-64 binaries and how to exploit a simple buffer-overflow vulnerability to gain code execution on a vulnerable server. These types of challenges are called _pwn_ challenges, and they are a great way to learn the fundamentals of binary exploitation and understand how low-level programs work.

We will look at how compiled code can be decompiled into assembly and pseudo-C, and we’ll explore common binary protections that can make buffer-overflows harder to exploit. We will cover what ELF binaries are, how to analyse them, and how to use CLI tools to gather more information about them. We will also work with disassemblers and decompilers to help us identify vulnerabilities.

**Who should attend?**

If you are curious about reverse-engineering and low-level exploitation, this class is for you!

**Goals**

In this class, you will learn the fundamentals of reverse engineering and binary exploitation on Intel x86-64 systems. You will explore how compiled programs work at a low level, how to analyse ELF binaries using command-line tools and disassemblers, and how to identify simple vulnerabilities in real code.

**Requirements**

*   Basic programming experience in C and Python.
    
*   Familiarity with the Linux command line (navigating directories, running commands, editing files).
    
*   A laptop with Docker installed.
