### What is it about?

The art and science of reverse-engineering software is a foundational skill in cybersecurity. It allows us to investigate exactly what a program is doing and how… without source code or documentation. This skill has applications in vulnerability assessments, software compatibility, similarity analysis, and exploitation. This workshop will provide students with a hands-on introduction to software reverse engineering using IDA.



### Knowledge prerequisites
No previous reverse engineering experience
is expected or required! Students should have basic knowledge of using
Linux, a terminal, and some previous programming experience in C
and/or Python.


### Hardware/Software prerequisites
We will provide students with a Linux virtual machine and all materials/software. Students are expected to run a ~20GB virtual machine. A recommended hardware configuration would have the following:

 - 40 GB of free hard disk space
 - 8-16 GB of RAM
 - At least 4 Processor cores
 - VMWare or Virtual Box to import the ova file

## Malware Development 101 by Alice Climent-Pommeret <a name="malware"></a>

### When
  - CET Friday 7:00 pm
  - IST Friday 11:30 pm
  - PST Friday 10:00 am
  - EST Friday 1:00 pm
  - AEST Saturday 4:00 am

### What is it about?

In this workshop, attendees will study malware from an unusual
standpoint, as malware developers.

Usually, at Blackhoodie workshop, attendees reverse and analyze compiled
malware and try to understand its purpose.

Here, we are going to learn basic malware injection techniques by
actually implementing them.

We will code malware performing:

- Self injection;
- Injection in a remote process;
- DLL injection in a remote process;
- Thread hijacking in a remote process;
- MapView process injection


We will then analyze our binary in live by using a debugger and Process
Hacker. By doing so, we will learn to identify these injection
techniques from the assembly code.

### Hardware/Software prerequisites

  - 16 Go of RAM
  - 30 Go of free disk space
  - Machine with Virtual Box installed (A Virtual Machine will be provided
before the worshop).


### Knowledge prerequisites

- Basic knowledge on x86 and x86_64 assembly languages.
- Basic knowledge on C.
- Basic knowledge on debugging.

### Bio

 I started my career after I hit rock bottom being a single mom who moved back to live with my parents. This was after dropping out of computer science in university, my professors told me I would not be good enough to get a job in computers. I had lost all passion for what I loved and hoped for the future. I worked with my caseworker (social assistance program) and they helped me gain the confidence to try computers again. I was able to teach myself programming and other computer science concepts on my own time (online courses). With this, I was able to regain my confidence regarding computers. I then became really interested in offensive security and applied to work at a cyber security company. I started as an entry-level analyst and worked my way up to starting my own threat research and detection department. I taught myself how to reverse engineer malware from scratch along the way and have not looked back since. If I can train an English teacher to reverse engineer malware, I have the confidence I can train anyone to get the task done. If you are looking for someone to lead your threat research and detection team who has done each job on the way up to the top, I might be the one you are looking for. Since then, I've presented research all across North America, appeared on TV as an expert twice and have not looked back. I love reverse engineering, malware analysis, detecting threat actors, the thrill of the hunt, mentoring other women who want to get into cyber security and most importantly, my family and the wonderful people on my team who have grown so much in their careers.

### Abstract
With the constantly changing landscape of IoT botnets it
requires a certain effort to stay on top of all the changes introduced
by attackers daily to make sure that both adequate detections and the
right naming constantly remain in place. Surprisingly, the quality and
the arsenal of malware functionality is not always improving or
increasing in quantity. In this presentation, we are going to explore
some peculiar modifications introduced by the botnet developers over
time and try to find an explanation to them.

## The Importance of Knowing Normal by Shelly Giesbrecht <a name="normal"></a>

### When
  - CET Saturday 2:15 am
  - IST Saturday 6:45 am
  - PST Friday 5:15 pm
  - EST Friday 8:15 pm
  - AEST Saturday 11:15 am

### Abstract

Whether a red or blue teamer, understanding what "normal" looks like in network traffic, on an endpoint, or when a program runs is crucial to understand. If you're a red teamer and trying to hide in plain sight, you need to know how to blend in. And if you're a blue teamer, you need to know what normal is so you can spot abnormal and stop it!

Shelly is a long time incident responder and will talk about some of the important points of "normal" and the dangers of not knowing.

### Bio

Shelly is a Director of Incident Response for CrowdStrike.

After many years in the help desk/desktop support trenches learning what normal was, Shelly moved to Security Operations to understand abnormal. She then followed her dream to never sleep again and joined the ranks of  IR consultants around the world putting out dumpster fires wherever they happen.

Shelly tries to learn one new thing every day, and is a firm believer in the bow-tie. Lego is not a toy, it’s a lifestyle.

## What is BlackHoodie?
BlackHoodie is a series of free, women-only reverse engineering bootcamps, which started in 2015 and in 2018 slowly became a global initiative, with events happening in different locations in Europe and the United States. More information on the idea of BlackHoodie and upcoming events can be found at [blackhoodie.re](https://blackhoodie.re)
