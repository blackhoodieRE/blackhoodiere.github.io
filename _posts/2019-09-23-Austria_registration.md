We promised some more information as well as the registrations for the
Austrian edition, here they are!

Below is the link to the registration form, as well as the complete
agenda with both tracks' presentation. Remember, there are no
beginner / advanced tracks this time, both will be equally as
challenging.

Looking forward to seeing you all there!

## TL;DR: basic facts ##

**What:** classes on mobile reverse engineering, both hardware and
software
<!-- I think, to be corrected depending on training's titles once we -->
<!-- get them? -->

**When:** December 7th & 8th, 2019 - 9am-6pm

**Where:** [Saint Pölten University of Applied
Science](https://www.fhstp.ac.at/en), Matthias Corvinus-Straße 15,

## Agenda ##

### Track 1: Introduction to Android Reverse Engineering ###

**Teacher:** Maddie Stone
<!-- Anyone wants to add something there? -->

**Topic:** This workshop will teach attendees how to reverse engineer
Android applications. We will cover both the Java and native code
(ARM) aspects of reversing Android applications. Attendees should be
ready to get their hands dirty with reversing malware, hunting for
vulnerabilities, and unpacking obfuscated code using Ghidra and jadx.

### Track 2: Mobile Hacking ###

**Teacher:** Priya Chalakkal

**Topic:** This workshop gives an introduction to smartphone security
covering basics of application layer and telecommunication layer. The
workshop will cover an introduction to mobile application pentesting,
mainly focusing on Android but also covering parts of iOS. This
includes owasp top 10 vulnerabilities and also basic reversing of
mobile applications. Then we will look into the telecommunication
layers, various network protocols involved in GSM and LTE and an
introduction to the security concepts in different layers.

**Prerequisites:** Students are requested to bring a rooted android
phone. There will be limited smartphones available during the
workshop. So it helps if you have your own. Also, a linux machine on
your laptop is necessary.

### Lightning talks ###

Did you work on something cool lately? Now is the time to talk to us
about it! For the first time ever, BlackHoodie will host lightning
talks, giving anyone who wants it an opportunity to talk about what
they do.

**Technical details:** The talks will be 5 or 10 minutes long, and
registration will happen on-site. But keep it in mind!

### Social dinner ###

The St. Pölten University of Applied Sciences will invite the
attendees for dinner on the 7th! They plan a typical Austrian dinner
with specialties such as Schweinsbraten, Wiener Schnitzel, Gulasch,
Apfelstrudel, Sachertorte, Kaiserschmarrn and so on!

## What is BlackHoodie? ##

BlackHoodie is a free, women only reverse engineering workshop. More
information can be found here: <https://www.blackhoodie.re/about/>.

### Why women-only? ###

The number of female engineers working on complex low level security
topics is crushingly low. My past teaching experience shows me, that
is not due to lack of interest in challenges, but has to do with
aspiring hackerettes sporting impressive anxieties. And I get it,
modern day computer security is an intimidating field, and the fact
that this field's engineers are usually all male, fancy death metal
fashion and are offensive by definition, doesn't help. But, among us,
one doesn't need to be male and death metal to be successful
there. The BlackHoodie workshops aim to make complex subjects more
tangible and less intimidating for women, in order to get motivated
hackerettes started on their security careers. It is not about
building walls around a minority, but about creating space, where
participants can build confidence, foster shared interests, build
connections, and in the end contribute themselves as part of a happier
community. It keeps fascinating me how many former BlackHoodies keep
sticking around, and do impressive work in several different areas of
security.
