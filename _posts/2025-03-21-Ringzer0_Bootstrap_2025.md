# **BlackHoodie at Ringzer0 Bootstrap 2025**

Howdy, y'all, again :D BlackHoodie is coming back to Austin! Our friends at Ringzero0 are hosting us again, and we're super happy to bring a compiler internals training to our esteemed community of women hackers. This 1-day class introduces students to security relevant aspects of compiler internals, and with guided examples enables students to perform their own code modifications through a compiler. 

## **TL;DR:**

**What:** Training on compiler internals and security

**When:** March 21st - 9am-5pm

**Where:** Thompson Conference Center, Austin, Texas

**Who:** Women

**Registration:** [fill form here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScGLV3Cw-T8N1nWnDG7YCTIgcWNxF3Zhgh088NEpZecoIoi2A/viewform?usp=header) (registration open until we reach capacity)

**Fees:** The training is free; food, travel and hotel is responsibility of attendees

## **Agenda**


### **Compiler Internals for Security Engineers**

**Teachers:** Marion Marschalek (@pinkflawd)

**Topic:** We'll set up an environment with which we can analyze source code through different compilation stages and by the end of the day students will be able to inject code to a given compiler stage. Students will gain understanding how compiler mitigations are placed into applications, and understand the security relevancy of a build chain.

**Prerequisites:** Bring a laptop on which you have permissions to install software, basic coding skills and Linux command line skills required, knowing basics of assembly is helpful but not required

## **What is BlackHoodie?**

BlackHoodie is a free, women only reverse engineering workshop and community. More information can be found here:[ https://www.blackhoodie.re/about/](https://blackhoodie.re/mission/)


### **Why women-only?**

One qualifies to attend an in-person bootcamp either if born and raised female, or if one identifies as a woman. This concept of women-only has no intention of putting up walls or feeling exclusive. Blackhoodie is about creating space in an industry that’s very competitive. It is a comfortable place, where attendees feel encouraged to grow skills without pressure. We do what we do, not to create women-only bubbles, as contradicting as it might sound, but to enable a minority to enter the security space, learn skills that are otherwise expensive to learn, find their interests and grow a professional network.

And, it works. BlackHoodie alumnae have gone far beyond being successful in the classroom since the workshop series started. They ventured out to start community projects and collaborations, got themselves new jobs in the security industry, went to speak at major security conferences, joined review boards and become influencers in our community. Many went on to mentor others after they had found their spot, came back to BlackHoodie to give trainings on their own or are now conference trainers and teach classes to the community.

Finally, why does the security industry need more women at all? The industry is growing and facing a talent shortage. More importantly, jobs are typically well paid, come with certain privileges, and are challenging and often fulfilling. And we do firmly believe our society as a whole can only benefit from having more women with money, independence and confidence. Likewise, the tech sector has grown in size and influence, and with great power comes great responsibility – responsibility best shared among a diverse body of decision makers.
